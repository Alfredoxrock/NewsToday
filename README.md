## About The Project

This is a college project for my senior CAPSTONE class. It is a prototype of
a news portal where users can create an account and upload their news to the
desktop application. It still has a room for improvement on the client side, and
their server side has to be set up to be able to save the information to a database.
After it has the necessary advances, the first version of the app could be launch on 
the microsoft store.
